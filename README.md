# Conway's Game of Life in Python

Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in an infinite space in Python. Alive cells are stored in a set. To calculate the next iteration, we compute the number of neighbors for each cell that has neighbors.


## Run an example

`python game_of_life.py`


## Running the tests
